    "description": "This study assesses the suitability of aviation accident autopsy samples as RNA sequencing input and for detecting gene expression differences between THC-positive and THC-negative samples. Postmortem brain, lung, muscle, and blood samples were collected from 57 aviation accident fatalities and comparisons were made between each tissue based on the presence or absence of THC or its primary or secondary metabolites (28 positive, 29 negative). RNA was extracted, and global transcriptional analysis was performed using total RNA-Seq. Twenty-two genes in lung (18 of which had Entrez annotation data) and four in muscle showed significant differential gene expression between THC-positive and THC-negative samples. It is possible that the observed expression patterns between the THC-positive and THC-negative groups were induced by smoking and not by THC, as many of the observed genes were also reported in the literature to change in response to smoking. Cannabis use is often accompanied by other substance use, and evidence of co-use was observed among some subjects. Therefore, we cannot state conclusively that the observed differences between the THC-positive and THC-negative groups were due solely to THC consumption, only that significant differences exist when the subject groups are so segregated. Regardless, this study is the first of its kind in reporting RNA-Seq data from postmortem tissues collected from aviation accident victims and that said data are of sufficient quality to derive significant differences between subject groups.\n\nThe total size of the zip file is 13.7 MB. The .csv, Comma Separated Value, file is a simple format that is designed for a database table and supported by many applications. The .csv file is often used for moving tabular data between two different computer programs, due to its open format. The most common software used to open .csv files are Microsoft Excel and RecordEditor, (for more information on .csv files and software, please visit https://www.file-extensions.org/csv-file-extension). The .html file extension is mainly related to the Hypertext Markup Language that provides means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. It is the main language for writing web pages. HTML formats texts, tables, images, and other content that will be displayed on the page that can be viewed using any web browser (for more information on .html files and software, please visit https://www.file-extensions.org/html-file-extension). The .txt file type is a common text file, which can be opened with a basic text editor. The most common software used to open .txt files are Microsoft Windows Notepad, Sublime Text, Atom, and TextEdit (for more information on .txt files and software, please visit https://www.file-extensions.org/txt-file-extension). An .sh file is a script that can be run with the Bash Unix shell. It contains instructions written in the Bash command language. Users can execute the commands an SH file contains by calling the file in a Bash shell (https://fileinfo.com/extension/sh). The .rmd file extension is associated with the RStudio, an integrated development tool for Windows, macOS (OS X) and Linux operating systems, which allows users to create apps with R programming language. The .rmd file stores R markdown data (for more information on .rmd files and software, please visit https://www.file-extensions.org/rmd-file-extension-r-markdown-data). A .tsv file is a very simple textual data format which allows tabular data to be exchanged between applications that use different internal data formats. These files can be opened using open-source programs such as Notepad or other open source, tabular file readers. These files are also known as .tab files (for more information on .tsv files, please visit https://www.file-extensions.org/tsv-file-extension). The file extension .md is among others related to texts and source codes in Markdown markup language. Markdown is a lightweight markup language, to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML) (for more information on .md files and software, please visit https://www.file-extensions.org/md-file-extension). File extension .json is associated to JavaScript Object Notation file format, a lightweight, text-based, language-independent data interchange format. JSON defines a small set of formatting rules for the portable representation of structured data. It is used by various applications as alternative option to XML file format. The data in a json file are stored in simple text file format and the content is viewable in any simple text editor (for more information on .json files and software, please visit https://www.file-extensions.org/json-file-extension).",

This layer is meant to be a reference layer and features public and private spaceport facilities in the United States. The information found on FAA\u2019s Office of Spaceports was used in creating this layer by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), found here https://www.faa.gov/space/office_spaceports. These facilities support the launching and receiving of spacecraft into and from space. As a result, U.S. spaceports have a critical role in the growing global commercial space transportation industry. The FAA Office of Spaceports is responsible for development of policies that promote infrastructure improvements and strengthen the competitiveness of U.S. spaceports, supporting launch and reentry site licensing activities, providing technical assistance and guidance to existing and proposed new spaceports, and the domestic and global promotion of U.S. spaceports. The mission of the FAA\u2019s Office of Spaceports is to enable the safest, most efficient network of launch and reentry spaceports in the world, along with a vision to advance a robust, innovative national system of spaceports supporting the U.S. as a global leader in the commercial space transportation industry.\n\nThe total size of the zip file is 0.23 MB.

    "description": "This study assesses the suitability of aviation accident autopsy samples as RNA sequencing input and for detecting gene expression differences between THC-positive and THC-negative samples. Postmortem brain, lung, muscle, and blood samples were collected from 57 aviation accident fatalities and comparisons were made between each tissue based on the presence or absence of THC or its primary or secondary metabolites (28 positive, 29 negative). RNA was extracted, and global transcriptional analysis was performed using total RNA-Seq. Twenty-two genes in lung (18 of which had Entrez annotation data) and four in muscle showed significant differential gene expression between THC-positive and THC-negative samples. It is possible that the observed expression patterns between the THC-positive and THC-negative groups were induced by smoking and not by THC, as many of the observed genes were also reported in the literature to change in response to smoking. Cannabis use is often accompanied by other substance use, and evidence of co-use was observed among some subjects. Therefore, we cannot state conclusively that the observed differences between the THC-positive and THC-negative groups were due solely to THC consumption, only that significant differences exist when the subject groups are so segregated. Regardless, this study is the first of its kind in reporting RNA-Seq data from postmortem tissues collected from aviation accident victims and that said data are of sufficient quality to derive significant differences between subject groups.",

The .csv, Comma Separated Value, file is a simple format that is designed for a database table and supported by many applications. The .csv file is often used for moving tabular data between two different computer programs, due to its open format. The most common software used to open .csv files are Microsoft Excel and RecordEditor, (for more information on .csv files and software, please visit https://www.file-extensions.org/csv-file-extension). The .html file extension is mainly related to the Hypertext Markup Language that provides means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. It is the main language for writing web pages. HTML formats texts, tables, images, and other content that will be displayed on the page that can be viewed using any web browser (for more information on .html files and software, please visit https://www.file-extensions.org/html-file-extension). The .txt file type is a common text file, which can be opened with a basic text editor. The most common software used to open .txt files are Microsoft Windows Notepad, Sublime Text, Atom, and TextEdit (for more information on .txt files and software, please visit https://www.file-extensions.org/txt-file-extension). An .sh file is a script that can be run with the Bash Unix shell. It contains instructions written in the Bash command language. Users can execute the commands an SH file contains by calling the file in a Bash shell (https://fileinfo.com/extension/sh). The .rmd file extension is associated with the RStudio, an integrated development tool for Windows, macOS (OS X) and Linux operating systems, which allows users to create apps with R programming language. The .rmd file stores R markdown data (for more information on .rmd files and software, please visit https://www.file-extensions.org/rmd-file-extension-r-markdown-data). A .tsv file is a very simple textual data format which allows tabular data to be exchanged between applications that use different internal data formats. These files can be opened using open-source programs such as Notepad or other open source, tabular file readers. These files are also known as .tab files (for more information on .tsv files, please visit https://www.file-extensions.org/tsv-file-extension). The file extension .md is among others related to texts and source codes in Markdown markup language. Markdown is a lightweight markup language, to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML) (for more information on .md files and software, please visit https://www.file-extensions.org/md-file-extension). File extension .json is associated to JavaScript Object Notation file format, a lightweight, text-based, language-independent data interchange format. JSON defines a small set of formatting rules for the portable representation of structured data. It is used by various applications as alternative option to XML file format. The data in a json file are stored in simple text file format and the content is viewable in any simple text editor (for more information on .json files and software, please visit https://www.file-extensions.org/json-file-extension).",

This layer is meant to be a reference layer and features public and private spaceport facilities in the United States. The information found on FAA\u2019s Office of Spaceports was used in creating this layer by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), found here https://www.faa.gov/space/office_spaceports. These facilities support the launching and receiving of spacecraft into and from space. As a result, U.S. spaceports have a critical role in the growing global commercial space transportation industry. The FAA Office of Spaceports is responsible for development of policies that promote infrastructure improvements and strengthen the competitiveness of U.S. spaceports, supporting launch and reentry site licensing activities, providing technical assistance and guidance to existing and proposed new spaceports, and the domestic and global promotion of U.S. spaceports. The mission of the FAA\u2019s Office of Spaceports is to enable the safest, most efficient network of launch and reentry spaceports in the world, along with a vision to advance a robust, innovative national system of spaceports supporting the U.S. as a global leader in the commercial space transportation industry.\n\nThe total size of the zip file is 0.23 MB.

      "description": "The Oak Ridge Commodity Flow dataset is from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)/Bureau of Transportation Statistics\u2019 (BTS\u2019) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD). The Oak Ridge Highway Planning Network is a database of major highways in the United States. It is a foundation for analytic studies of highway performance, for vehicle routing and scheduling problems, and for mapping purposes. The network is based on a set of roadways digitized from the National Atlas by the U.S. Geological Survey. It has been enhanced at Oak Ridge National Laboratory by adding additional roads and attribute detail and correcting topological errors to produce a true analytic network.  This documentation is intended primarily to assist users of this database by describing its structure, data elements, and development.\n\nThe total size of the zip file is 7.08 MB.

      "description": "This study assesses the suitability of aviation accident autopsy samples as RNA sequencing input and for detecting gene expression differences between THC-positive and THC-negative samples. Postmortem brain, lung, muscle, and blood samples were collected from 57 aviation accident fatalities and comparisons were made between each tissue based on the presence or absence of THC or its primary or secondary metabolites (28 positive, 29 negative). RNA was extracted, and global transcriptional analysis was performed using total RNA-Seq. Twenty-two genes in lung (18 of which had Entrez annotation data) and four in muscle showed significant differential gene expression between THC-positive and THC-negative samples. It is possible that the observed expression patterns between the THC-positive and THC-negative groups were induced by smoking and not by THC, as many of the observed genes were also reported in the literature to change in response to smoking. Cannabis use is often accompanied by other substance use, and evidence of co-use was observed among some subjects. Therefore, we cannot state conclusively that the observed differences between the THC-positive and THC-negative groups were due solely to THC consumption, only that significant differences exist when the subject groups are so segregated. Regardless, this study is the first of its kind in reporting RNA-Seq data from postmortem tissues collected from aviation accident victims and that said data are of sufficient quality to derive significant differences between subject groups.",
