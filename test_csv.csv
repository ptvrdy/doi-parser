DOTNTL,57336,Cost Evaluation for Nine Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards Vol. IV: FMVSS 202 & 207,United States. Department of Transportation. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,United States. Department of Transportation. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,1979-11-01,English,PDF,Text,"The consumer cost was established for the implementation cost of each of the nine Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The standards study are: FMVSS 105 Hydraulic Brake Systems on Passenger Cars; FMVSS 108 Side Marker Lamps; FMVSS 122 Motorcycle Brake Systems; FMVSS 202 Head Restraints; FMVSS 207 Seating Systems; FMVSS 213 Child Seating Systems; FMVSS 220 School Bus, Rollover Protection; FMVSS 221 School Bus, Joint Strength; and, FMVSS 222 School Bus, Seating and Crash Protection

For each standard a representative sample of makes and models of vehicles or components was established. The components required to meet the standard were purchased and their costs estimated. The first year of the imposition of the standard and the year immediately preceding it were emphasized. By analysis, the consumer costs attributed to the standard for each make and model or components were determined. A weighted average was developed from the samples and applied to the total industry volumes to determine the consumer cost for the implementation of each standard. The weighted average of weight variance due to the implementation of the standard was also determined. The before and after cost variance was not applied to FMVSS 213 Child Seating Systems and the FMVSS 122 Motorcycle Brake Systems.",DOT-HS-8-02015,DOT-HS-805 318,dot:29973,https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/29973
