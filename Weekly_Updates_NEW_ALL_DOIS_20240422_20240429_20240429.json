    "description": "Extended reality (XR) is a collection of technological modalities that have increasingly grown and expanded over several decades. The technology\u2019s growth and expansion has given way to new and novel use cases across an array of practical applications. XR is a unifying term that describes existing technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR), and is expected to describe similar future technologies in this area. Several industries are applying various aspects of XR into training and daily operational tasks. Yet, there is a general lack of data-based evidence that significantly supports XR\u2019s use as an effective training modality in trade-specific and adult learning applications. Beyond the science of knowledge transfer, airlines are looking to regulatory authorities to approve and certify the use of this technology in flight attendant training, among others. Work is underway to develop such guidance for regulators, as is scientific research to understand if there are any quantifiable benefits or value in incorporating this technology into the classroom or workflow. Research in these areas is needed the most. Each area requires the input, cooperation, and collaboration from an array of knowledge reservoirs among industry, academia, and government to understand the best application of this technology in Advanced Qualification Programs and traditional Part 121 N and O training approaches. The future of XR in training and operational job tasks is broad. There is also potential for positive outcomes in other areas such as passenger education, integration with emerging technologies and trends, and cabin safety research.",

      "description": "Extended reality (XR) is a collection of technological modalities that have increasingly grown and expanded over several decades. The technology\u2019s growth and expansion has given way to new and novel use cases across an array of practical applications. XR is a unifying term that describes existing technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR), and is expected to describe similar future technologies in this area. Several industries are applying various aspects of XR into training and daily operational tasks. Yet, there is a general lack of data-based evidence that significantly supports XR\u2019s use as an effective training modality in trade-specific and adult learning applications. Beyond the science of knowledge transfer, airlines are looking to regulatory authorities to approve and certify the use of this technology in flight attendant training, among others. Work is underway to develop such guidance for regulators, as is scientific research to understand if there are any quantifiable benefits or value in incorporating this technology into the classroom or workflow. Research in these areas is needed the most. Each area requires the input, cooperation, and collaboration from an array of knowledge reservoirs among industry, academia, and government to understand the best application of this technology in Advanced Qualification Programs and traditional Part 121 N and O training approaches. The future of XR in training and operational job tasks is broad. There is also potential for positive outcomes in other areas such as passenger education, integration with emerging technologies and trends, and cabin safety research.",
